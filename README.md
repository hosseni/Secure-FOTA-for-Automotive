## Project Overview

I am excited to present the successful completion of my graduation project, "Secure FOTA for Automotive." This project centers around enhancing the security of the bootloader system, particularly in the context of automotive applications. By reinforcing the bootloader's security, we aimed to ensure safe and reliable firmware updates for automotive systems.

## Enhancing Bootloader Security

One of the primary goals of this project was to improve the security of the bootloader system. To achieve this, we implemented the bootloader using a Controller Area Network (CAN) controller and incorporated the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm. This strategic approach was aimed at mitigating potential vulnerabilities, preserving the integrity of firmware updates, and maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive data during transmission.

## Simulating Real Car Applications

To create a comprehensive and realistic testing environment, we developed additional applications that simulate essential functionalities within a real car setting. These applications not only added depth to the project but also contributed to its practicality and relevance.

### 1. Dashboard using Nextion Screen

</p>

We designed and implemented an interactive dashboard interface utilizing a Nextion screen. This dynamic dashboard displays real-time information crucial to the driving experience, such as speed, fuel level, temperature, and more. By providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface, we aimed to enhance user engagement and facilitate seamless interaction with critical vehicle metrics.

### 2. Object Avoidance System

</p>

Safety is of paramount importance in automotive systems. To address this aspect, we integrated an object avoidance system into our project. Leveraging advanced sensor technologies, we developed algorithms that detect obstacles in the vehicle's path and enable intelligent maneuvering to avoid collisions. This feature contributes significantly to a secure and accident-free driving experience.

### 3. MP3 Player Functionality

Entertainment is an integral part of the driving experience. As such, we designed and implemented an MP3 player application within our project. This application allows users to enjoy their favorite music while on the road. The MP3 player supports various audio formats and provides an easy-to-use interface for convenient music playback and control.

## Conclusion

"Secure FOTA for Automotive" project showcases the integration of enhanced security measures into the bootloader system and the creation of simulated automotive functionalities. By emphasizing security, realism, and user engagement, this project contributes to the advancement of secure firmware updates and safe driving experiences in the automotive industry.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey and the remarkable outcomes achieved in this graduation project. Your interest and support are greatly appreciated.
